# Exploratory Data Analysis on the Iris Dataset
This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the well-known Iris dataset. It aims to uncover patterns and relationships within the data that can be useful for further machine learning tasks such as classification.

## Overview
The Iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species:
Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica

Each sample includes the following features:
Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)

## Key Objectives
Understand the structure and distribution of the dataset.
Visualize feature relationships.
Analyze class distributions and feature separability.
Extract insights to guide future ML modeling.

## Files in This Repository
EDA_Iris_Dataset_Pravallika.ipynb - Main Jupyter notebook containing all the analysis and visualizations.
README.md - Project documentation.

## EDA Steps Covered
Dataset loading and preview
